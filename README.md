# Haskell Learning Journal

This repo consists of:

- Collection of my experiment code snippets and exercise solutions while following the book ["Haskell from the First Principle"](https://haskellbook.com/)
- My reading notes on the book ["Haskell from the First Principle"](https://haskellbook.com/)

Handwritten notes (mostly for chapters 1 to 7) are accessible at [this link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rybC2CqcZXqwmq7ajfSgz9aA5kEth8sQ).

To clone this repo: 

```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/mnhthng-thms/Haskell-Learning-Journal.git
```

### NOTES

- Due to my packed schedule, I've intended to finish all exercises. Most of the time, I left a chapter at the point when I felt I'd done enough exercises to grasp the concepts. If you stumble upon this repo looking for solution for a chapter exercise, I personally recommend this [`heitor-lassarote`'s repo](https://github.com/heitor-lassarote/haskell-programming-from-first-principles) and this [`BoeingX`'s repo](https://github.com/BoeingX/haskell-programming-from-first-principles)
- I've not planned to maintain this repo in the near future.
